# MahApps-WebBrowser
MahApps v1.6.0-alpha0184 fail to display contain of some websites in WebBrowser as popular browsers.

This is a bug report issue. The app loads website "https://www.barchart.com/stocks/signals/top-bottom/top". The display is not formatted in accordances with popular browsers output. I generated a bug report as the hosting github site.
